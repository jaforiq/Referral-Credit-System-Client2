## Project overview

A referral and credit-tracking web app built with **Next.js (TypeScript)** and **Tailwind CSS**. The system demonstrates: secure user auth, referral links/codes, purchase simulation, credit rewards (first purchase only), and an admin-style dashboard to monitor referral activity.

Key functional requirements implemented:

- User registration, login, logout
- Unique referral code per user and referral relationship tracking.
- First-purchase credit reward (2 credits each for referrer and referred) with protections against double-crediting.
- Purchase simulation button (client-side call to API) ‚Äî only the first successful purchase by a referred user triggers credits.
- Dashboard: Total referred users, referred users who purchased, total credits earned, and copy/share referral link.
